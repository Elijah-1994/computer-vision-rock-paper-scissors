# computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors

This file contains a project called computer vision rock paper scissors where the aim is create a rock-paper scissors games which will compare the user input with the computers choice. The computers choice was developed by creating a computer vision system model on teachable-machines.

Milstone 1 - create the computer vision system

Teachable-Machine was used to creat the model. This consisted of creating four classes which represent Rock,Paper,Scissors and Nothing. for each class I took roughly 1000 images to build the model.

Once all the images were taken the model was trained and downloaded from the "Tensorflow" tab. the model is labbeled as "keras_model.h5" and contains a "labels.txt" file which contains the classes with the corresponding index.
