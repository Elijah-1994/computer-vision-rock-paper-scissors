# computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors

This file contains a project called computer vision rock paper scissors where the aim is create a rock-paper scissors games which will compare the user input with the computers choice. The computers choice was developed by creating a computer vision system model on teachable-machines.

Milstone 1 - create the computer vision system

I went onto Teachable-Machine to create model. This consisted of creating four classes wich are rock,paper,scicors and nothing. for each class I took roughly 300 images to represent each class. for the nothing class I took photos of myself.

Once I took all the images in each class I click build model and downloaded the model from the "Tensorflow" tab. the model is labbeled keras_model.h5 and contains a labels.txt file which contains the created classess.
